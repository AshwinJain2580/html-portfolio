<h3>1. Kolar Gold Fields (K.G.F.) - Chapter 1 and 2</h3>

<p>This is one of my favourite movie.I really like the these type of gangsters based movies.</p>

<h3>2. Kantara</h3>

<p>I really like the concept of demigods on which this movie is based upon and the importance of traditional culture namely Kola that is shown in this movie.</p>

<h3>3. M.S. Dhoni - The untold story</h3>

<p>I really like this motivational movie in which it is shown that how Mahi struggled and made his way into the Indian Cricket Team. I am a big fan of MS Dhoni sir and this movie which is actually his auto biography is really inspiring to me.</p>
